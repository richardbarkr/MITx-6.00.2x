# Problem 5: RandomWalkRobot Class

# iRobot is testing out a new robot design. The proposed new robots differ in that they change direction randomly after every time step,
# rather than just when they run into walls. You have been asked to design a simulation to determine what effect, if any, this change has
# on room cleaning times.

# Write a new class RandomWalkRobot that inherits from Robot (like StandardRobot) but implements the new movement strategy.
# RandomWalkRobot should have the same interface as StandardRobot.

# Test out your new class. Perform a single trial with the StandardRobot implementation and watch the visualization to make sure it is
# doing the right thing. Once you are satisfied, you can call runSimulation again, passing RandomWalkRobot instead of StandardRobot.

# Enter your code for classes Robot and RandomWalkRobot below.

# Enter your code for Robot and RandomWalkRobot in this box
