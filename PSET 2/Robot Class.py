# Problem 2: Robot Class

# In ps2.py we provided you with the Robot class, which stores the position and direction of a robot. For this class, decide what fields
# you will use and decide how the following operations are to be performed:
# Initializing the object
# Accessing the robot's position
# Accessing the robot's direction
# Setting the robot's position
# Setting the robot's direction

# Complete the Robot class by implementing its methods in ps2.py.

# Note: When a Robot is initialized, it should clean the first tile it is initialized on. Generally the model these Robots will follow is
# that after a robot lands on a given tile, we will mark the entire tile as clean. This might not make sense if you're thinking about
# really large tiles, but as we make the size of the tiles smaller and smaller, this does actually become a pretty good approximation.

# Although this problem has many parts, it should not take long once you have chosen how you wish to represent your data. For reasonable
# representations, a majority of the methods will require only a couple of lines of code.)

# Note: The Robot class is an abstract class, which means that we will never make an instance of it. Read up on the Python docs on
# abstract classes at this link and if you want more examples on abstract classes, follow this link.

# In the final implementation of Robot, not all methods will be implemented. Not to worry -- its subclass(es) will implement the method
# updatePositionAndClean()

# Enter your code for classes RectangularRoom (from the previous problem) and Robot below.


# Enter your code for RectangularRoom (from the previous problem)
#  and Robot in this box
